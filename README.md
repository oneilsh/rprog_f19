# rprog_f19

Assignment templates for Data Programming in R, Fall 2019 at OSU. 

### How to use - desktop

To use these in RStudio Desktop, go to File -> New Project -> Version Control -> Git. In the URL field, enter `https://github.com/oneilsh/rprog_f19.git`. This will clone the project down to your computer; from there, find the `hw1` folder, and check out the `hw1.Rmd` and `hw1.pdf` files. 

### How to use - rstudio.cloud

You can also use `rstudio.cloud`, but the clone process is different. In rstudio.cloud, go to a workspace, and click the dropdown arrow next to "New Project," and select "New Project from Git Repo". Enter the url  `https://github.com/oneilsh/rprog_f19.git`, and similarly find the `hw1` folder and check out the `hw1.Rmd` and `hw1.pdf` files. 

### How to get updates

New homeworks will be added as we cover the material for them. To get the latest homework folders, click the gray-red-and-gree "Git" icon, and select "pull branches". The "History" entry in that dropdown can be used to see what changes were made when, though the interface is a liiitle clunky.
